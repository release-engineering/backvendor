Backvendor
==========

This command inspects a Go source tree with vendored packages and attempts to work out the versions of the packages which are vendored, as well as the version of top-level package itself.

It does this by comparing file hashes of the packages with those from the upstream repositories.

If no semantic version tag matches but a commit is found that matches, a pseudo-version is generated.

Installation
------------

```
go get github.com/release-engineering/backvendor
```

Running
-------

```
$ backvendor -h
backvendor: help requested
usage: backvendor [OPTION]... PATH
  -debug
        show debugging output
  -deps
        show vendored dependencies (default true)
  -exclude-from string
        ignore glob patterns listed in provided file
  -help
        print help
  -importpath string
        top-level import path
  -template string
        go template to use for output with Rev, Tag and Ver
```

In many cases backvendor can work out the import path for the top-level project. In those cases, simply supply the directory name to examine:
```
$ backvendor src
```

If it cannot determine the import path, provide it with -importpath:
```
$ backvendor -importpath github.com/example/name src
```

By default both the top-level project and its vendored dependencies are examined. To ignore vendored dependencies supply -deps=false:
```
$ backvendor -deps=false -importpath github.com/example/name src
```

If there are additional local files not expected to be part of the upstream version they can be excluded:
```
$ cat exclusions
.git
Dockerfile
$ ls -d src/Dockerfile src/.git
src/Dockerfile
src/.git
$ backvendor -exclude-from=exclusions src
```

Example output
--------------

```
$ backvendor -importpath github.com/docker/distribution go/src/github.com/docker/distribution
*github.com/docker/distribution@90705d2fb81dda1466be49bd958ed8a0dd9a6145 ~v2.6.0rc.1-1.20180831002537-90705d2fb81d
github.com/opencontainers/image-spec@87998cd070d9e7a2c79f8b153a26bea0425582e5 =v1.0.0 ~v1.0.0
github.com/ncw/swift@b964f2ca856aac39885e258ad25aec08d5f64ee6 ~v1.0.25-0.20160617142549-b964f2ca856a
golang.org/x/oauth2@2897dcade18a126645f1368de827f1e613a60049 ~v0.0.0-0.20160323192119-2897dcade18a
rsc.io/letsencrypt ?
...
```

In this example,

* github.com/docker/distribution is the top-level repository (indicated by \*)
* github.com/opencontainers/image-spec had a matching semantic version tag (v1.0.0)
* github.com/ncw/swift's matching commit had semantic version tag v1.0.24 reachable (so the next patch version would be v1.0.25)
* golang.org/x/oauth2 had a matching commit but no reachable semantic version tag
* rsc.io/letsencrypt had no matching commit (because the vendored source was from a fork)
* for github.com/docker/distribution, tag v2.6.0rc.1 was reachable from the matching commit (note, 1.timestamp instead of 0.timestamp)


Pseudo-versions
---------------

The pseudo-versions generated by this tool are:

* v0.0.0-0.yyyyddmmhhmmss-abcdefabcdef (commit with no relative tag)
* vX.Y.Z-pre.0.yyyyddmmhhmmss-abcdefabcdef (commit after semver vX.Y.Z-pre)
* vX.Y.(Z+1)-0.yyyyddmmhhmmss-abcdefabcdef (commit after semver vX.Y.Z)
* tag-1.yyyyddmmhhmmss-abcdefabcdef (commit after tag)

Limitations
-----------

The vendor directory is assumed to be complete.

Original source code is assumed to be available.

Only git and repositories are currently supported, and working 'git' and 'hg' executables are assumed to be available.

Non-Go code is not considered, e.g. binary-only packages, or CGo.

Commits with additional files (e.g. \*\_linux.go) are identified as matching when they should not.

Packages vendored from forks will not have matching commits.

Files marked as "export-subst" in .gitattributes files in the vendored copy are ignored.
